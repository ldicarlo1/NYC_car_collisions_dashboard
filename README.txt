This directory contains an RShiny application that displays an interactive data dashboard.

The dataset is the NYC Vehicle Collisions Dataset, and has been cleaned/preprocessed from its original size
of 397 MB to 85 MB. 

The original data is available for download from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/accidents/yjf6-ewhz/data

In order to run the app.R file to see the dashboard, simply download this repository and run the app.R file in 
an R editor.
